# ER Diagrams

DB Lens allows you to visualize the relationships between tables in your
database using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs). This feature is particularly
useful for understanding the structure of your database and how different tables
are related to each other.

## Viewing ER Diagrams

To view an ER diagram, click on the `ER` tab in the sidebar or by opening
"https://local.dblens.app/erd" in your browser. This will open the ER diagram
view, which shows the relationships between tables in your database.
