# Quick Start

## Using NPX

You can use `npx` to run DB Lens without installing it. To do this, run the
following command:

```bash
npx dblens <postgres_connection_string>
```
Replace `<postgres_connection_string>` with your actual Postgres connection
string.

## Installer (Legacy)

You can also download the installer from the
[Releases](https://github.com/dblens/app/releases) page and install it on your
system.

> Note: This is a legacy method and will not be getting updates in the future.
