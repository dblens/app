# Explorer

The Data explorer view on DB Lens allows you to view and manage your databases
in a more intuitive way. It is designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use tool
that can be used by anyone, regardless of their technical background.

## Schema and Table View

The left sidebar of the explorer view shows the schema and table structure of
the database. You can select a schema to view the tables and columns within it.
